# Structural Cellular Hash Chemistry

This repository contains several Mathematica codes and aggregated data files related to the following publication:
 * Hiroki Sayama, Structural Cellular Hash Chemistry, Proceedings of the 2025 IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence (IEEE SSCI 2025 -- IEEE ALIFE-CIS 2025), March 17-20, 2025, Trondheim, Norway, IEEE, in press.

Details of the files are as follows:
* SCHC-interactive-demo.nb
  - Mathematica code for running an interactive visual simulation of Structural Cellular Hash Chemistry (SCHC).
* SCHC-systematic-sim.nb
  - Mathematica code for running systematic simulations of SCHC and generating log files.
* SCHC-systematic-sim-data-analysis.nb
  - Mathematica code for reading the simulation log files and generating aggregated data files.
* SCHC-systematic-sim-data-analysis-curve-fitting.nb
  - Mathematica code for plotting and curve fitting on the aggregated data files.
* ***.dat
  - Aggregated data files generated by SCHC-systematic-sim-data-analysis.nb.
 
Some aminations of the simulation results are also available on https://www.youtube.com/@ComplexSystem/videos .
